### Additional Information

#### Why AI-Powered Comebacks?

The internet can be a harsh place. People often leave mean comments that can hurt feelings. **Comeback AI** aims to turn those negative interactions into positive experiences. By generating clever responses, users can engage with humor instead of hostility.

#### How Does It Work?

The heart of **Comeback AI** lies in its AI algorithms. We use pre-trained models from Hugging Face and OpenAI to generate responses based on the input provided. The personas add a layer of personality, making each comeback unique.

#### Future Enhancements

We plan to introduce more features, such as:

- **User Profiles**: Save your favorite comebacks.

- **Mobile Compatibility**: Ensure a seamless experience on mobile devices.

Stay tuned for updates!
